	 * <p>
	 * The characters of the <tt>StringBuffer</tt> argument are
	 * appended, in order, to the contents of this
	 * <tt>AppendingStringBuffer</tt>, increasing the length of this
	 * <tt>AppendingStringBuffer</tt> by the length of the argument. If
	 * <tt>sb</tt> is <tt>null</tt>, then the four characters
	 * <tt>"null"</tt> are appended to this <tt>AppendingStringBuffer</tt>.
	 * <p>
	 * Let <i>n</i> be the length of the old character sequence, the one
	 * contained in the <tt>AppendingStringBuffer</tt> just prior to execution
	 * of the <tt>append</tt> method. Then the character at index <i>k</i> in
	 * the new character sequence is equal to the character at index <i>k</i>
	 * in the old character sequence, if <i>k</i> is less than <i>n</i>;
	 * otherwise, it is equal to the character at index <i>k-n</i> in the
	 * argument <code>sb</code>.

	 * The method <tt>ensureCapacity</tt> is first called on this
	 * <tt>AppendingStringBuffer</tt> with the new buffer length as its
	 * argument. (This ensures that the storage of this

	 * characters being appended.)
	 * 
	 * @param sb
	 *            the <tt>StringBuffer</tt> to append.
	 * @param from
	 *            The index where it must start from
	 * @param length
	 *            The length that must be copied
	 * @return a reference to this <tt>AppendingStringBuffer</tt>.
