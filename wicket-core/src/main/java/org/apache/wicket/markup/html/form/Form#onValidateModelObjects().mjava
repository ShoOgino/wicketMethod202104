	 * allows outside frameworks to validate any beans that the form is updating.
	 * 
	 * This validation method is not preferred because at this point any errors will not unroll any
	 * changes to the model object, so the model object is in a modified state potentially
	 * containing illegal values. However, with external frameworks there may not be an alternate
	 * way to validate the model object. A good example of this is a JSR303 Bean Validator
	 * validating the model object to check any class-level constraints, in order to check such
	 * constraints the model object must contain the values set by the user.
